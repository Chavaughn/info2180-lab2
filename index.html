                        <h2>The League of Depression</h2>

                        <p>I once was a happy and cheerful individual, that was until I was peer pressured into
                            downloading the
                            literal embodiment of sadness called League of Legends. My friend said to me "Come on Chav
                            it's a
                            great game, you'll love it". I have never expierenced such treachery before in my entire
                            life. This
                            continued until I was addicted to the drug called league of <s>depression</s> Legends. I
                            have been
                            corrupted and begun to do the same thing as my friend... spread the depression. During the
                            spread of
                            depression I have observed many side effects of playing League of legends this includes but
                            is not
                            limited to: Lack of females, the inability to touch grass, the severe urge to bring others
                            into this
                            depression, mild to extreme racism and sadness</p>

                        <p>The game is not bad despite the community being filled with toxic influences and sheer
                            racisim
                            inducing teammates. The game can be enjoyed with friends in custom modes or even in the
                            featured
                            gamemodes. My friends and I enjoy League of Legends you should join us and play as well :).

                            Went up to her room

                            But then she started screamin'
                            Like, "Where the --- your --- go?"
                            Whoa there, --- that
                            I forgot to stay strapped
                            She said, "Where'd your peepee go?"
                            I guess that I misplaced that
                            This shit, don't make, any sense at all
                            I was feelin' so confused

                            But one night, I took it off and I swear to God I can't find it (What?)

                            I didn't think she would mind it, ay (Huh?)

                            Can't believe I left this --- with a hoe (brrr, brrr)
